# NMS---Frontier-Update-Buy-QuickSilver-Items
*Makes all the Expedition Rewards Purchasable with Quicksilver *You will not have to complete any expeditions to purchase the rewards. *These rewards will be purchasable at any Tier Level, as long as you have Quicksilver to buy them. ---> This MOD replaces some items you would normally see for sale with the Expedition Rewards items. Once you purchase the Expedition Rewards with this mod (and create a save point), it is safe to remove. If you remove this Mod the Quicksilver Shop Items will return to normal, and you still can keep the Expedition items you bought.  **Works with Normal, Survival and Permadeath Game Modes **  *This MOD is compatible with the latest version of No Man's Sky and backwards compatible with all previous versions of the game as of September 5, 2021.  Install Instructions: Extract (Unzip) the "pak" file (PurchaseRewards.pak) from "Quicksilver Rewards (FRONTIER UPDATE).zip" into your "MODS" folder, usually found here: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\No Man's Sky\GAMEDATA\PCBANKS\MODS. If no MODS Folder exist, then create it in your PCBANKS folder and name it: "MODS" (without the quotation marks). Now rename the "DISABLEMODS.TXT" file in the PCBANKS folder to "ENABLEMODS.TXT" (without the quotation marks). If you installed it correctly, the next time you run No Man's Sky you should see a MOD warning, just press any key to continue.
